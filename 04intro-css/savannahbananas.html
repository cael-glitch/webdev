        <h1>The Savannah Bananas</h1>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Bananas">Savannah Bananas</a> are an exhibition baseball team based in Savannah, Georgia, known for their unique brand of "Banana Ball" â€“ a fast-paced, fan-focused version of baseball with unconventional rules and abundant entertainment. Founded in 2016, they quickly became a national phenomenon, often compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for their showmanship and competitive, unscripted games.</p>

        <section class="bananas-border">
            <h2 class="bananas-header">Team History and Achievements</h2>
            <p class="bananas-info">The Bananas began as a collegiate summer baseball team in the Coastal Plain League (CPL), where they secured three Petitt Cup championships in 2016, 2021, and 2022. In 2023, the team transitioned fully to playing Banana Ball exhibition games against their touring opponents, including the Party Animals, Firefighters, and Texas Tailgaters. Their innovative approach has garnered widespread media attention from outlets like ESPN, The Wall Street Journal, CNN 10, and Sports Illustrated.</p>

            <p class="bananas-info">The Savannah Bananas' "Banana Ball" rules are designed for speed and fun, featuring a two-hour time limit, no bunting, no stepping out of the batter's box, and points awarded for each inning won rather than traditional runs. This format allows for continuous entertainment, with players performing dance routines, comedic sketches, and engaging with the crowd. The Bananas even feature a player who pitches, bats, and fields on stilts, standing at 10-feet 9-inches tall. They have a significant social media presence, boasting over 10.5 million followers on TikTok as of 2025.</p>

            <h2 class="bananas-header">Home Field and Touring</h2>
            <p class="bananas-info">The Bananas' home ballpark is <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?cid=9395290885437681665">Grayson Stadium</a> in Savannah, Georgia, which opened in 1926 and has a capacity of 5,000. However, their popularity has led them to embark on extensive "Banana Ball World Tours," playing in numerous cities across the country. In 2025, they announced plans to play games in 40 cities, including three NFL stadiums and 17 MLB stadiums. They notably played in front of a sold-out crowd of 65,000 at Raymond James Stadium, the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and an even larger crowd of 80,000 at Clemson University's Memorial Stadium.</p>

            <h2 class="bananas-header">Notable Players and Appearances</h2>
            <p class="bananas-info">While the Bananas' roster primarily consists of former minor league and college baseball players, they have also featured several former MLB stars as guest players or coaches. These include Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench, World Series champions Johnny Damon and Jonny Gomes, Cy Young winner Jake Peavy, and six-time All-Star Jonathan Papelbon. In a significant move in 2024, Jocelyn Alo became the first woman to officially join the Bananas roster, signing a one-month contract. They later signed Kelsie Whitmore, a high-profile professional woman baseball player, in August 2025.</p>
