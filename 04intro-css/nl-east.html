        <h1>National League East Teams</h1>
        <p>The National League East division was created in 1969. It currently consists of five teams: the Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Nationals. The division is notable as one of two in Major League Baseball where all member teams have won at least one World Series title. The Atlanta Braves have won the most division titles with 18.</p>

        <section class="braves-border">
            <h2 class="team-section-header braves-header">Atlanta Braves</h2>
            <p class="braves-info">The Atlanta Braves are the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in America, founded in Boston in 1871. They moved to Milwaukee in 1953 and then to Atlanta in 1966. They play at Truist Park. The Braves experienced a remarkable run from 1991 to 2005, winning 14 consecutive division titles and a World Series in 1995. They also won World Series titles in 1914, 1957, and 2021. Their team colors are navy blue, scarlet red, and silver. Key players include Hank Aaron, Warren Spahn, Eddie Mathews, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Chipper Jones, and Ronald Acuña Jr.</p>

They play at LoanDepot Park, which opened in 2012. Their team colors are midnight black, Miami blue, Caliente red, and slate grey.

They initially played at the Polo Grounds before moving to Shea Stadium in 1964 and later to Citi Field in 2009. Their colors evoke the blue of the Dodgers and the orange of the Giants. The Mets have won two World Series titles (1969 and 1986) and five National League pennants. They are tied with the Houston Astros for the most pennants won by an expansion team in MLB history. The Mets are also the only expansion team to have clinched multiple World Series championships at home.
