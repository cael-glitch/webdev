        <h1>The Texas Tailgaters</h1>
        <p>The <a href="https://banana-ball.fandom.com/wiki/The_Texas_Tailgaters">Texas Tailgaters</a> are the newest team in the Banana Ball universe, introduced in October 2024 by Fans First Entertainment. They serve as a rival to the Savannah Bananas and Party Animals, bringing a distinct Texas theme to the on-field entertainment and pre-game festivities. The Tailgaters were officially announced with a distinct "tailgating" flair, complete with players wearing cowboy hats and serving hot dogs to the crowd.</p>

        <section class="tailgaters-border">
             <h2 class="tailgaters-header">Team Announcement and Debut</h2>
            <p class="tailgaters-info">The Texas Tailgaters were unveiled to the world in October 2024, appropriately on the tailgate of a pickup truck. The team marks a significant milestone for Banana Ball as the first semi-regional team to be introduced, reflecting the brand's growing national footprint. While initially based in Savannah, Georgia, the team is set to headline games in Texas throughout September 2025. The Tailgaters will also travel extensively to play against the Bananas, Party Animals, and Firefighters as part of the Banana Ball World Tour.</p>

            <p class="tailgaters-info">The Tailgaters have been actively engaged on social media, showcasing videos of their players' impressive backflip catches and entertaining entrances. Their debut games, including a series against the Party Animals, have already sold out, demonstrating the significant fan interest in the new squad.</p>

            <h2 class="tailgaters-header">Team Culture and Players</h2>
            <p class="tailgaters-info">Embracing their "Lone Star" identity, the Texas Tailgaters' on-field antics are centered around a tailgate party theme. This includes players wearing cowboy hats, serving hot dogs to the crowd, and putting on a pre-game show known as "the Greatest Pregame in Sports". The team's coaching staff includes Joe Mikulik, Andrew Bartman, and Brandon Pennington.</p>
            <p class="tailgaters-info">The team's roster is comprised of experienced players, including several former Minor League and college standouts. Notable players on the 2025 roster include pitcher and Austin native Jimmy Lewis (formerly of the Los Angeles Dodgers), infielder Jorden Hussein (from Houston), and infielder Jonathan "Sunshine" Luders, who is known for playing on a unicycle. A diverse group of players representing different parts of Texas and beyond contributes to the team's fun and dynamic atmosphere.</p>

In September 2025, they are scheduled to play against the Party Animals in Texas. Earlier in 2025, the Tailgaters faced off against the Savannah Bananas in MLB stadiums, including Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati.
