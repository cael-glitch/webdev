        <h1>American League Central Teams</h1>
        <p>The American League Central Division, often abbreviated AL Central, consists of five teams located in the Midwestern United States. It was established in 1994 as part of a league-wide realignment. At its creation, it included the Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Minnesota Twins. In 1998, the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the National League Central, and the Detroit Tigers joined the AL Central from the AL East. This lineup remains to this day, with the Cleveland team officially changing its name to the Cleveland Guardians at the end of the 2021 season. The AL Central is notable as one of two divisions (along with the NL East) where all member teams have won at least one World Series title.</p>
