        <h1>National League East Teams</h1>
        <p>The National League East division was created in 1969. It currently consists of five teams: the Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Nationals. The division is notable as one of two in Major League Baseball where all member teams have won at least one World Series title. The Atlanta Braves have won the most division titles with 18.</p>
