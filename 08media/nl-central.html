        <h1>National League Central Teams</h1>
        <p>The National League Central division was created in 1994 as part of a league-wide realignment. It was originally composed of five teams from the NL West (Reds, Astros) and NL East (Cubs, Pirates, Cardinals). The Milwaukee Brewers joined the NL Central in 1998, moving from the AL Central. Houston left for the AL West in 2013. The division is known for strong rivalries, including the Cubs-Cardinals and Brewers-Cubs matchups.</p>
