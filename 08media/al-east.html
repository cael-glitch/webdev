        <h1>American League East Teams</h1>
        <p>The American League East division was created in 1969 as Major League Baseball expanded and reorganized its leagues into divisions. Initially, it included six teams: the Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, and Washington Senators. After the Senators moved in 1971 and became the Texas Rangers in the AL West, the Milwaukee Brewers moved into the AL East to maintain balance. The Toronto Blue Jays joined as an expansion team in 1977. When MLB realigned into three divisions in 1994, the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers moved to the AL Central. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays were added as an expansion team in 1998, with their name changing to the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008. This division is often considered one of the toughest in baseball.</p>
