The American League's initial teams included the Boston Americans, Chicago White Stockings, and Detroit Tigers. The Boston Red Sox were initially known as the Boston Americans until 1908. The Cincinnati Red Stockings were among the National League's original members in 1876 and were known for their uniforms, inspiring the use of team colors as nicknames.
